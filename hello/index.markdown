I probably gave you my business card - it was awesome to meet you.  Ok, I know that sounds disingenuous.  I couldn't possibly know who is looking at this page, so how can I say that?  

Because if I gave you a card, it means I want to talk to you again.

So trust me.  It was awesome to meet you.



### Who am I?



I'm a software engineer, [Pluralsight trainer](http://pluralsight.com/training/Authors/Details/robert-horvick), [author](http://www.syncfusion.com/resources/techportal/ebooks/datastructurespart1), and all-around nice guy.

My passion is helping good people do great things.  I could probably help you too.
