I track my runs on Endomondo.com – today’s run is [here](http://www.endomondo.com/workouts/scUe-c0GP_U).

 

Started too fast and finished too slow – but overall not bad.  On the plan.

 

I think tomorrow is going to be 8x400’s at the track with a focus on mid-foot strike rather than heel strike.  I noticed when I did that today my speed bumped up about 50% but I was getting gassed within a 1-2 minutes.  I need to build that up and improve my form.  If I can do both at the same time … awesome. ![Smile](http://www.roberthorvick.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/wlEmoticon-smile.png)

 

Maybe I can convince one or both of my boys to come with.
