**Update:** I learned how to do what I wanted but the answer sucks.  Thankfully in version 8 the story is much better.  So for version 7 I used a duplicated data source with distinct global filters.

While learning more about [Tableau ](http://tableausoftware.com)I have been putting together some visualizations that make use of actions and filters.  Basic stuff, I know.

To that end I used a [UNHCR dataset](http://data.un.org/Data.aspx?d=UNHCR&f=indID%3aType-Ref#UNHCR) from the UNdata site.  This data set shows the number of refugees by country or origin and asylum.

My biggest surprise so far?  8 Americans are refugees in Australia (which answers what I'll be googling about tonight).

Here is the current visualization.  <del>At the moment I'm only half-happy with it.  Right now I can answer the question "Where do the refugees in XXX come from?" but I also want to also be able to answer "Where do the refugees from XXX go to?" without creating a second dashboard or chart on the dashboard.  (I'm open to suggestions).</del>

So here it is (updated)



Data source: [data.un.org](http://data.un.org/Data.aspx?d=UNHCR&f=indID%3aType-Ref#UNHCR)

Feedback greatly appreciated.
